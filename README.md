```

Run docker image:

{
"itemId":1,
"requestingAmount":400
}
```


## Response object type

### Sucess
```json
[{"SupplierMailId":"Person5@gmail.com","scaled_prediction":64}, ....]
```
### Failture
```json
{
  "resMsg": "Our suppliers won't be able to do this request"
}
```

To check the ml service working fine whether you don't have any new data hit the following endpoint using post method with a empty body

```
You will be reciving following body
